## Advanced Programming - Assignment 2

As making an executable program hasn’t been taught in the lectures, a JAR file has been compiled. To run the “Data Analytics” JAR file, use this command without the quotes:

"java -jar {module paths} {jar path}"

E.g., 

java -jar --module-path /Users/jcb/Documents/RMIT/SDK/javafx-sdk-21/lib/ --add-modules=javafx.controls,javafx.fxml,javafx.graphics,javafx.base '/Users/jcb/Documents/Java/data-analytics/data-analytics.jar'
